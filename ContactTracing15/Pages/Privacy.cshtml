<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Contact tracing is an important part of the government's strategy for managing the spread of COVID-19 in the UK. This is what gov.uk has to say about the need for contact tracing:</p>
<p>"COVID-19 is an infectious disease affecting the whole of the country. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a coronavirus. Infectious diseases present a serious and ongoing threat to public health. If not controlled, they can infect large numbers of people and, depending on the disease and other factors, can result in ill-effects ranging from relatively minor symptoms to early death.</p>
<p>Contact tracing is an important way of controlling the spread of infectious diseases. It involves identifying and tracing all the people who have been in contact with a person who has been infected. Depending on the nature and duration of the contact, these contacts may require advice or treatment to prevent the disease from spreading further."</p>
