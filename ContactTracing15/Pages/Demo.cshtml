<h1>For demonstration purposes on Wed 12th May</h1>
<p>This website serves as a integrated platform for the contact tracing process, where testers upload test results, contact tracers work on cases and government actors analyse data. </p>
<p>All of the website functionality can be reached through the <b>sign-in button</b> at the top-right.</p>
<p>We suggest that you sign in first as a tester, then a tracer, and lastly a government actor to see the full story of a case going through our system.</p>

<h3>Testers</h3>
<p>Tester users fill in the details of a positive case they've just performed. Try adding a new case!</p>

<p>Tester username: <b>"tester2@123.com"</b>       Password: <b>"dummypassword"</b></p>

<h3>Contact Tracers</h3>
<p>Once you've added a new case, you should see it appear on the contact tracer's dashboard. A contact tracer would then be expected to phone/email each case and then fill in who they've been close to in the last few days. These "contacts" of a case are then either contacted manually by phone, or automatically by email. (Don't worry, we've turned off the sending of emails for this demo!)</p>
<p>Be aware that any changes you make will be visible to all others using the demo, so please don't close or drop cases other than your own.</p>
<p>Tracer username: <b>"tracer2@123.com"</b>       Password: <b>"dummypassword"</b></p>

<h3>Government actors</h3>
<p>Government actors can explore the data generated by the system, via a simple dashboard.</p>
<p>Gov actor username: <b>"gov2@123.com"</b>       Password: <b>"dummypassword"</b></p>


<h4>Warning:</h4>
<p>This system is not designed to support multiple people logging in with the same usernames simultaneously. This may result in concurrency bugs, particularly for the contact tracer users.</p>
